# CodeExamples
Past projects and code I have done

Red Cross Project:
A high school project where I was challenged to clean three datasets of West African health facilities, points of interest, and rapid assessment centers to
analyze water, sanitation, and community resources for future disease outbreaks. Created plots to determine electricity, water, and operator sources of health
facilities.

kmeans_clusters and kmeans_identify:
An ENGR 151 project to create a KMeans machine learning algorithm to determine an unknown car's type from 7 distinct features.
